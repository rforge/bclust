Description: Builds a dendrogram using log posterior as a natural distance defined by the model and meanwhile waits the clustering variables. It is also capable to computing equivalent Bayesian discrimination probabilities. The adopted method suites small sample large dimension setting. The model parameter estimation maybe difficult, depending on data structure and the chosen distribution family.
