Description: The package builds a dendrogram with log posterior as a natural distance defined by the model. Spike-and-Slab models are adopted in a way to be able to produce an importance measure for clustering variables. The method works properly for data with small sample size and high dimensions. The model parameter estimation maybe difficult, depending on data structure.
