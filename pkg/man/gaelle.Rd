\description{The Data consist of replicates of 14 mustants to study
metabolite pathways of genetically modified samples of Arabidopsis
thaliana. The metabolite data consist of 14 genetically modified samples of
the plant \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} grown in three batches. Values
of 43 metabolites are measured for each sample which are supposed to monitor their
genetic changes. The data involve two mutants defective in starch
biosynthesis, \emph{pgm} and \emph{isa2}; four defective in starch
degradation \emph{sex1}, \emph{sex4}, \emph{mex1}, and
\emph{dpe2}; a mutant for comparison that accumulates starch as a
pleitropic effect, \emph{tpt}; four uncharacterised mutants,
\emph{deg172}, \emph{deg263}, \emph{ke103}, and \emph{sex3};
and three wild type plants, \emph{WsWT}, \emph{RLDWT}, and
\emph{ColWT}. There are four replicates of all samples except the
last for which there are three \url{http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/abstract/143/4/1484}.
